# Player Controller

Modified from DGriffin's modified [Bevy FPS Controller](https://github.com/DGriffin91/BevyJam2022-2/blob/main/bevy_fps_controller/).

I wanted the task of adding wall running to a player controller that wasn't intended for it while also getting the feel of Source games. I also plan to implement a third person camera swap for this controller hence the move away from labeling it as bevy_fps_controller.
